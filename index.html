     <ul>
       <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
      <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
      <li>!DOCTYPE declaration states the type of document the browser is expected to open</li>
      <li>HTML attributes (lang="en") need to be defined at the beggining, not at the end of the element</li>
      <li>Metadata tags include title, style, base, link, meta and script</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Inline CSS - syle an element directly in the HTML file. Applies to specific HTML tag. Good for quick changes, but less flexible because each element needs editing individually.</li>
        <li>Most frequent - external as it allows all design changes to be kept separate. It is brought in as a link element.</li>  
        <li>Separation of concerns principle - each section of code had its own responsibility</li>
<li>A CSS rule is formed of a selector and a declaration block. The selector defined the element or attributes to which the rules (declarations) will apply. Declarations are formed of a property and its value. Example Color is a property and blue is the value.
  Margin and padding are different properties. The margin states the amount of space around the outside of an element while padding refers to the space inside and element. The element gets bigger the more padding is added. CSS box model describes HTML elements as boxes with margins outside the element and the element consisting of content, padding and borders.</li>
<li>DRY - Do Not Repeat Yourself principle - combine or share pieces of code to reduce the number of lines written or maintained. Example: header, footer { - combined two selectors into one CSS rule with a comma.</li>
<li>CSS styles make a website visually appealing and simpler to use.</li>
